# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

Overview: The project aims to analyze the Amazon Vine program to determine if there is a bias toward favorable reviews for Vine members. We are instructed to use PYSpark to perform the ETL process, extract the datasets, transform the data, connect to an AWS, RDS data, load and transform the data into pgAdmin and calculate the different metrics. We need to use Amazon Reviews Datasets. and software such as the Google Colab Notebook, PostgreSQL, pgAdmin, and AWS to complete the assignment.

Result: The first question is to provide an answer to the number of Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews
The total number of reviews is 4864249, and the total number of five stars is 3076917
The second question is to determine the number of Vine reviews that were 5 stars and the number of non-reviews that were 5 stars.
The total number of paid numbers of paid reviews is 1266, and the total number of paid 5 stars reviews is 432.
The third question is to find the percentages of Vine reviews that were 5 stars and the rate of non-Vine reviews that were stars
The percentage of paid 5 stars reviews is 43.1percent, and the rate of unpaid 5 stars reviews is 48.3 percent.

Summary: Based on the Vine Review analysis result, there is no sign of bias because a slightly higher percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5-stars reviews. But it is worth mentioning that the issue may be related to the small number of participants in the studies, and a small percentage of the total reviews were paid vine reviews. Due to those factors mentioned above, a repeat analysis within each category would clearly understand positivity bias within the research. Additionally, analyzing the statistical distribution (means, median, and mode) of the 5 stars rating for the vine and non-vine reviews would better understand the research.
